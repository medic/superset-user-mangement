# ðŸ§° Superset Bulk Users

> This is a MVP script for loading bulk users to Superset via the [API](https://superset.apache.org/docs/api/). It expects a csv file, see /src/template.csv for a sample.

#### How it works
1. It uses the permissions of the default dashboard viewer role to create custom roles from the csv
2. It creates users and assigns them roles (1:1 mapping). The tables to be accessed are defined in the .env file
3. It create row-level-security entries to ensure role based access to the dashboards

#### How to use it
1. Populate your csv file, refer to the `./src/template.csv` for a sample
2. Define your environment variables - make a copy of `.env.template` and rename to `.env`
3. Install dependencies: run `npm i`
4. Build: run `npm run build`
5. Start: run `npm run start`

### Scripts
